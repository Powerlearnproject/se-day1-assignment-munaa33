Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering has evolved over time through various advancements. Three key milestones in its development are:
a)	Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)-This approach replaced unstructured programming, making code more organized and easier to read. It introduced loops, functions, and control structures, improving software quality and reducing errors.
b)	Development of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduced concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. This made software more reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain, leading to the development of languages like Java and C++.
c)	Adoption of Agile and DevOps (2000s-Present)-Agile methodologies improved software development by making it more flexible and adaptive through iterative updates and customer feedback. DevOps further enhanced this by integrating development and operations, enabling continuous deployment and automation.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software. The main phases are:
a)	Requirement Analysis – This is the first phase where developers gather and analyze user needs to define what the software should do. A Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document is created.
b)	Planning – In this stage, the project scope, budget, timeline, and required resources are determined. It helps in risk assessment and decision-making.
c)	Design – The system’s architecture, interface, and database structures are planned. High-level and low-level designs are created to ensure smooth development.
d)	Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications using programming languages. This is the phase where the software takes shape.
e)	Testing – The software is tested to find and fix bugs, security flaws, and performance issues. Different testing techniques, like unit testing and system testing, are used to ensure quality.
f)	Deployment – After successful testing, the software is released for users. It may first go through a beta version before full deployment.
g)	Maintenance & Support – After deployment, regular updates, bug fixes, and improvements are made to keep the software functional and up-to-date



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a linear and structured process where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. Since changes are difficult once a phase is finished, it is best for projects with fixed and clear requirements. For example, developing a banking system, building medical software, or designing an aircraft control system requires strict planning, compliance, and minimal flexibility.
Agile is flexible and iterative, allowing development in short cycles called sprints, with continuous testing and user feedback. Changes can be made at any stage, making Agile ideal for projects where requirements evolve. For instance, creating a social media app, developing an online shopping platform, or building a startup’s website requires constant updates based on user behavior and market trends.
In summary, Waterfall is best for highly structured, stable projects, while Agile is suited for fast-changing, user-driven environments.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a)	Software Developer
A software developer is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the code that builds software applications. They translate project requirements into functional programs, debug errors, and optimize performance. Developers also collaborate with designers, analysts, and other team members to ensure smooth integration of different components.
b)	Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards by identifying and fixing defects before deployment. They design and execute test cases, perform manual and automated testing, and report any issues to developers. Their role is crucial in improving software reliability, security, and overall user experience.
c)	Project Manager
A project manager oversees the entire software development process, ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the required specifications. They coordinate between developers, testers, and stakeholders, manage risks, resolve conflicts, and track progress to keep the team aligned with project goals.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential for writing, testing, and debugging code efficiently. They provide features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools, improving productivity and reducing errors. Examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.
Version Control Systems (VCS) help track code changes, enable collaboration, and allow developers to revert to previous versions when needed. They prevent conflicts when multiple developers work on the same project. Git, along with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, is widely used for version control.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Tight Deadlines
•	Software engineers often face pressure to complete projects within strict timelines.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting clear, specific, and effective instructions (prompts) to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses. It involves structuring queries in a way that maximizes the AI’s ability to understand and provide useful outputs.
Improves Response Accuracy – Well-structured prompts help AI models generate more precise and contextually relevant answers.
Enhances Efficiency – Optimized prompts reduce the need for multiple queries by ensuring the AI provides the right response on the first attempt.
Enables Customization – Users can tailor prompts to get AI-generated content suited for different needs, such as summaries, explanations, or creative writing.
Reduces Bias and Misinterpretation – Clear and detailed prompts minimize ambiguity, preventing misleading or biased responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt
"Tell me about technology."
Improved Prompt
"Explain how artificial intelligence is used in healthcare, with real-world examples."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
The original prompt is too broad and lacks focus, making it difficult for an AI or any responder to provide a useful answer. "Technology" covers a vast range of topics, from electronics to medical advancements, leading to a vague or unfocused response.
The improved prompt is clear, specific, and concise because:
1.	It focuses on AI, a specific area of technology.
2.	It defines the industry, which is healthcare.
3.	It requests examples, ensuring a more informative and structured response.
This refinement helps in getting a detailed, relevant, and actionable answer, making it more effective in practical scenarios.
